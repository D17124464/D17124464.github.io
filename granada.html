    <h2 class="blog-title">Granada</h2>
    <div class="blog-content">
	<p>Granada is somewhere worth spending a few days if you have the time, to fully enjoy the Alhambra, the Albacín, Sacromonte and still have time to fit in a few tapas crawls! If you're interested, the word tapas comes from the spanish 'tapa' meaning 'lid' as the tapa used to be placed on top of glass of red wine as a lid as such and also so that food would be served with the alcohol! The trick is not to order your food until you see what free tapas arrives first, otherwise you won't be able to eat it all believe me! Granada is also the perfect place to learn Spanish, apart from being one of the most difficult accents I'm told! Even though it attracts many tourists, any attempt at Spanish is welcomed and many don't have English so you may not have a choice!</p>

    <h2 class="blog-title">Alhambra</h2>
    <div class="blog-content">
      <p>The famous Alhambra imposes over the city and is fabulous both in day and night time. Both a palace and fortress it dates back to the 13th century. Make sure to get tickets well in advance as this is always booked out. The Nasrid Palace will have a particular time slot and everything else including the General Life can be seen at your leisure. A Granada Card which also includes entry to cathedral and many other monuments could be worth investigating if tickets are scarce. You can walk around the back of the Alhambra back into town at any time and also remember that you can go to certain areas within the grounds without tickets - tickets are mainly for the Nasrid Palaces and General Life. </p>

    <h2 class="blog-title">Day Trips</h2>
    <div class="blog-content">
      <p>Granada is a great place to use as a base and take some day trips. Guadix which is the main photo on this page is an hour outside Granada and contains many more cave houses which are worth seeing! Pampaneira is a mountain village a couple of hours by bus in the Alpujarras region just south of the Sierra Nevada. It is a very quaint white painted village with great views and windy streets where you will find water ducts running through from the mountains.   </p>

    <h2 class="blog-title">In a day</h2>
    <div class="blog-content">
      <p> A lot can be seen in a day or maybe two. After the Alhambra, be sure to go to several of the Miradors or Viewpoints so that you can actually see a good view of the Alhambra! The Mirador San Nicolas in the Albacín quarter is the best view and is generally filled with tourists and stalls. It is also worth wandering around the plazas in the Albacín and venture up to Sacromonte area from there and see some cave houses! The Cathedral and Capilla of course should not be missed and be sure to have a stroll down Paseo de los Tristes down by the Rio Darro to get another great view of the Alhambra - especially at night!
